        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The Dominican Republic Showcase website is designed to highlight the country's culture, traditions, food,
            and landmarks in an interactive way. The site will serve as both an educational resource and a fun
            exploration of what makes the Dominican Republic unique.
        </p>
        <P>
            Visitors will be able to:
        </P>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn about Dominican traditions, festivals, and music.</li>
            <li>Discover iconic landmarks and must-try Dominican dishes.</li>
            <li>Engage with interactive features like a random proverb generator and a random recipe generator.</li>
            <li>Enjoy fun facts and trivia about the country’s history, famous figures, and achievements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This project also serves as a way for me to showcase my web development skills, focusing on HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, while sharing something deeply personal and meaningful.
