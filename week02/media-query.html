            <h2>Heleman 5:12</h2>
            <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer,
                who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when
                the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea,
                when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power
                over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon
                which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.

                in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.
